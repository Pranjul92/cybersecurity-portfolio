# Post Incident Review — IR-2026-001

**Incident Type:** Ransomware  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Date:** 2026-02-24  
**Affected Host:** WIN-ENDPOINT01  
**Affected User:** WIN-ENDPOINT01\lab-s  
**Incident Handler:** Pranjul Nayyar  
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2

## Incident Summary

On 2026-02-24, a simulated ransomware attack was executed against WIN-ENDPOINT01 via a phishing document (`Invoice_Q1_2026.docm`). Upon opening and enabling macros, a VBA script silently executed a multi-stage PowerShell payload that encrypted 200 user files, dropped a ransom note, and abused `certutil.exe` as a LOLBin. The attack was detected by Splunk at 14:05 HKT — 4 minutes after execution — with 7 of 8 configured detections firing successfully.

---

## Phase 1 — Preparation

Pre-incident baselines were captured on WIN-ENDPOINT01 before the simulation:

- Running services → `C:\IR\baseline_services.csv`
- Scheduled tasks → `C:\IR\baseline_tasks.csv`
- Local user accounts → `C:\IR\baseline_users.csv`
- Active network connections → `C:\IR\baseline_connection.csv`

Eight detection rules were configured in Splunk across Labs 2 and 3, covering macro execution, encoded PowerShell, download cradles, LOLBin abuse, admin account creation, mass file modification, ransom note creation, and bulk encryption.

**Preparation Finding:** The default SwiftOnSecurity Sysmon config did not monitor `.encrypted` file creation events. Custom `FileCreate` rules were added before the simulation, confirming that generic telemetry configurations require active tuning to cover scenario-specific threat indicators.

> **Note:** Alert firing order in the SIEM reflects when Splunk completed each scheduled search, not the chronological order of events. All 7 fired in the same 5-minute schedule window. Actual attack sequence was reconstructed via forensic log analysis below.

### SIEM Investigation

**Office Application Spawning Shell** — Sysmon EventCode=1 confirmed `WINWORD.EXE` as the direct parent of `powershell.exe`. This is the highest-value detection for macro-based initial access and is the first pivot point for any analyst investigating this incident.

- [Office Spawning Shell Evidence](../screenshots/02-office-spawning-shell.png)

**Bulk File Encryption** — Sysmon EventCode=11 captured 200+ `.encrypted` file creation events from `powershell.exe` within a 2-minute window.

### Attack Timeline

Reconstructed using the following Splunk forensic query across `sysmon`, `windows_security`, and `powershell` indexes:

```spl

- [Attack Timeline Output](../screenshots/07-attack-timeline.png)

| Time (HKT) | Stage | Event | MITRE |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14:01:00 | Initial Access | WINWORD.EXE opened, macros enabled | T1566.001 |
| 14:01:05 | Execution | WINWORD.EXE → powershell.exe via WScript.Shell | T1059.001 |
| 14:01:10 | Encoded PS + Download Cradle | Obfuscated PS, Invoke-WebRequest to external URL | T1027, T1105 |
| 14:01:15 | Privilege Escalation | Admin account creation — FAILED | T1136.001 |
| 14:01:20 | Encryption | 200 files encrypted in C:\UserData | T1486 |
| 14:03:05 | Ransom Note | README_RANSOM.txt dropped | T1486 |
| 14:03:10 | LOLBin | certutil.exe -encode | T1140 |
| 14:03:15 | Anti-Forensics | stage2.ps1 self-deleted | T1070 |
| 14:05:00 | Detection | 7 Splunk alerts fired | — |

### Key Forensic Findings

**Privilege Escalation Failed**
Admin account creation (`net user RansomAdmin /add`) failed because the macro-spawned PowerShell process ran in user context — `WScript.Shell` inherits the privilege level of the parent process (WINWORD.EXE). In a real attack, threat actors would use a UAC bypass or local privilege escalation exploit before this stage. Importantly, this failure did not prevent significant impact — user-context access was sufficient to encrypt all 200 target files.

**Anti-Forensic Self-Deletion**
The payload deleted `stage2.ps1` and `payload.dat` from `%TEMP%` after execution — realistic behavior designed to hinder post-incident forensic analysis. The macro source remains preserved in the `.docm` file.

**Detection Lag**
A 4-minute gap existed between attack execution and the first alert. Two compounding delays: Splunk Universal Forwarder log ingestion cycle (~1-2 minutes) and scheduled alert search interval (up to 5 minutes). The entire attack completed before any detection fired. While within the 10-minute target, this window represents a real risk in production environments.

### Indicators of Compromise

| Indicator | Type |
|---|---|
| `Invoice_Q1_2026.docm` | Malicious file |
| `%TEMP%\stage2.ps1` | PowerShell payload (self-deleted) |
| `%TEMP%\payload.dat` | Simulated downloaded payload |
| `*.encrypted` | Encrypted file extension |
| `README_RANSOM.txt` | Ransom note |
| `RansomAdmin` | Attempted persistence account |
| `WINWORD.EXE → powershell.exe` | Key behavioral indicator |

## Phase 3 — Containment, Eradication & Recovery

### Containment

Endpoint isolated from network to prevent lateral movement. Forensic evidence captured before remediation — processes, connections, users, and scheduled tasks exported and compared against pre-incident baselines. Affected user account (`lab-s`) temporarily disabled. Encryption confirmed limited to `C:\UserData` (200 files) with no spread to network shares.

**Time to Containment:** 55 minutes

### Eradication

All malicious artifacts removed: macro-enabled document, ransom notes, 200 encrypted files. Persistence mechanisms checked — no additional footholds found beyond the failed `RansomAdmin` account (deleted). Office macros disabled via Group Policy. Windows Defender signatures updated and quick scan completed.

**Time to Eradication:** 90 minutes

### Recovery

User files restored from last known-good backup. User account re-enabled with mandatory password reset. Network connectivity restored. Enhanced Splunk monitoring queries configured for 7-day post-recovery watch period.

**Time to Recovery:** 2.5 hours

## Phase 4 — Post-Incident Activity

### IR Metrics

| Metric | Actual | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time to Detection | 4 minutes | < 10 minutes | ✅ |
| Time to Containment | 55 minutes | < 1 hour | ✅ |
| Time to Eradication | 90 minutes | < 4 hours | ✅ |
| Time to Recovery | 2.5 hours | < 8 hours | ✅ |
| Detections Fired | 7 of 8 | 8 of 8 | ⚠️ |
| False Positive Rate | 0% | < 5% | ✅ |

### What Went Well

- All 7 expected detections fired within 4 minutes — well within target
- WINWORD.EXE → powershell.exe parent-child chain confirmed — attack origin established immediately
- Full kill chain reconstructed in minutes using a single SPL forensic query
- Zero false positives during the simulation window

### What Could Be Improved

- **Sysmon gap** — default config excluded `.encrypted` monitoring; required manual tuning before detections would fire
- **4-minute detection lag** — attack completed entirely before first alert; real-time alerting or EDR would close this window
- **No prevention controls** — macros enabled, no ASR rules, no email gateway; the attack succeeded because prevention was absent, not because detection failed

### Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| 🔴 Immediate | Disable Office macros via Group Policy |
| 🔴 Immediate | Implement real-time alerting for Critical severity detections |
| 🟠 Short-term | Deploy email security gateway to strip macro-enabled attachments |
| 🟠 Short-term | Enable Windows Defender ASR rules — block Office from spawning child processes |
| 🟠 Short-term | Security awareness training — phishing and macro risks |
| 🟡 Long-term | Deploy EDR for real-time behavioral detection and automated response |
| 🟡 Long-term | Implement immutable backup solution isolated from production network |
| 🟡 Long-term | Quarterly ransomware tabletop exercises |

### MITRE ATT&CK Coverage

| Technique | Description | Detected |
|---|---|---|
| T1566.001 | Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment | ✅ |
| T1059.001 | PowerShell Execution | ✅ |
| T1027 | Obfuscated Files or Information | ✅ |
| T1105 | Ingress Tool Transfer | ✅ |
| T1136.001 | Create Account: Local Account | ❌ Attack failed |
| T1486 | Data Encrypted for Impact | ✅ |
| T1140 | LOLBin — certutil | ✅ |
| T1070 | Indicator Removal — self-deletion | ❌ Detection gap |
| T1490 | Inhibit System Recovery | ❌ Not simulated |

**Detection Coverage: 6 of 9 applicable techniques (67%)**

## Conclusion

This simulation successfully demonstrated end-to-end incident response capability — all IR phases completed within target thresholds and the full attack kill chain was reconstructed from Splunk telemetry. The most significant outcome is the identification of concrete prevention gaps. The attack succeeded not because detection failed, but because it was never prevented. Detection is not a substitute for prevention.

The failed privilege escalation, rather than being a shortcoming, reflects realistic ransomware behavior — operators proceed with encryption under the current user context when escalation fails. User-level access is sufficient to cause a major incident.
